Virtualization : In the same system we are creating another subsystem 
On a single server we are able to create multiple vm ( virtual machines ) 
Containerization : Instead of hypervisor we are creating container run time engine that is nothing but docker it is tool with the help of the tool able to create multiple containers , for each container we have mini os 
Mini os : striped version of OPERATING SYSYTEM 
>>All the resources assighned to container are dynamic 
Microservices & Monolithic 
Monolithic application : Whole application in a single entity 
Drawback :it is very difficult to debugging the application 

Microservices :whole application is running out multiple entities by using this micro services we can debug easily by comparig the monolithic aplication 

State full application & stateless application 

Stateless application : we don't need to maintain the data or store the data 
ex : medium website 

It is a technical blogging website, something related to technical stuff in which users use to write some stuff here .

State full Application :It is a long procedure and it is used to store the data 
Example : Bookmyshow 


Devops : It is like automation tools with the help of some tools we are going to automate the sdlc (s/w development life cycle ).
