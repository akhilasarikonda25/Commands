Virtualization : In the same system we are creating another subsystem .
On a single server we are able to create multiple vm ( virtual machines ) 
Containerization : Instead of hypervisor we are creating container run time engine that is nothing but docker it is tool with the help of the tool able to create multiple containers , for each container we have mini os 
Mini os : striped version of OPERATING SYSYTEM.
>>All the resources assighned to container are dynamic .
Microservices & Monolithic 
Monolithic application : Whole application in a single entity 
Drawback :it is very difficult to debugging the application 

Microservices :whole application is running out multiple entities by using this micro services we can debug easily by comparig the monolithic aplication 

State full application & stateless application 

Stateless application : we don't need to maintain the data or store the data 
ex : medium website 

It is a technical blogging website, something related to technical stuff in which users use to write some stuff here .

State full Application :It is a long procedure and it is used to store the data 
Example : Bookmyshow 


Devops : It is like automation tools with the help of some tools we are going to automate the sdlc (s/w development life cycle ).

Devops life cycle : 
1) 3 developers are writing a code in the company , so inorder track the individual's code we are using " source code management tool as "git " afterpushing the code to the git  we cannot give that entire code to the end users , end user should not understant the code so the developers this entirecode is pushed in to the executable file as a " Build " .

2) In build we are using the MAVEN tool in order to build the entire source code .

3)  After build we have to test the code by using some automations tools based on code which we have written based on programing language will use tools 

4) For ex python code we are using robotic framework 

5) and java we are using selenium , cucumber 

6)  in devops for t automate the testcases we are using tool called "JENKINS " .

7) Terraform is an infra provisioning tool , we can run the scripts and it can be used with multiple clouds .
 
8) Ansible is the Infra configuration management tool we can run the scripts by creating some jobs 

9) While creating the infra we are using the terraform , to configure the infrea we need ansible , and to deploy the infra we need kubernettes .

10) Jfrog /nexus artifactory managemenent tools.

Tools we are used in devops 

1) Git - Source code management tool 

2) Docker - creating containers 

3) Terraform - Creating the infra

5) Ansible -Configure the infra

6) kubernettes-Application Deployment

7)nagios - monitoring the code 

8) Maven- Build purpose
